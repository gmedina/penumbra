# Shadow DOM
========

Before anything else remember to turn on the following flags in Crome (chrome://flags)
* Web Platform features
* Experimental Javascript

Also, in the dev tools, go to config and check the "Show Shadow DOM".

The code here is messy, but might be interesting to play around with.

The contents are just static files with some markup, css and js.
